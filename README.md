Project title -
'Efficiency of LOSSLESS IMAGE COMPRESSION TECHNIQUES on uncompressed image format (BMP)'


This project explores image compression by employing complex data structures and tailored algorithms that allow for great compression for storage purposes.
We have explored the following lossless compression techniques -
1. Huffman Encoding (custom implementation)
2. Deflate Compression (available standard)
These algorithms have been employed on BITMAP image (BMP) files, which is an uncompressed data format. We have studied these algorithms in details and their effeciencies for several types of images, and recorded the results.

Programming language: C++
